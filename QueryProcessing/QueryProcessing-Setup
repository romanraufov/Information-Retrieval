# initialize weight:
    -iterate through all keys
    -get number of docs
    -per document:
        -get number of tf
        -apply idf and store it 


# query processing:
    -normalize query (same way as docs) DONE
    -find query term in dict 
    -return top 5 docs in ranking order (accumulator array implementation):
        -determine rank by simple starting metric
        -assemble all weights per document
        -sum weights per document
        -return document corresponding to their summed weight in descending order 
        -for now a cut off at 5
