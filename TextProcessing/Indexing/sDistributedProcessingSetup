# Multiprocessing


# Multiple machine have to be able to run at the same time.
# There is one main csv form which the lines are going to be parsed
# A text file should be maintained, tracking what lines have been/are being parsed
# Separate Dicts should be saved, first into separate pickle files
# Separate Script to combine the batches into one main file.
