How to update the index

1) new list of documents have been gained
2) how to adapt index?
    -merge docs into old docs and rebuild index (lame-version)
    -build new index based on list of new docs and merge this index into the old index (kick-ass version)

3) how to merge?
merge new list with old list for TF-IDF
    -iterate through new index:
        - if term is not in old index, simply put it in
        - more likely, if the term is in the old index:
            - go to docs   
                -iterate through docs in new index
                    -if they are in old index:
                        replace it and replace the values in "freq" and "pos list"
                    -if not:
                        add it them
                recalculate DF
                recalculate TF-IDF
            throw away old index

Its probably a good practise to keep track of when what files have been merged
